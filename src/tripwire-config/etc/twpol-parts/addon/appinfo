# /opt/myapp   -> $(SEC_CRIT) (recurse = 1);
#

#
# a post section for a roll might look like
# <post>
# if [ ! -e /opt/tripwire/etc/twpol-parts/addon ]; then
#	mkdir -p /opt/tripwire/etc/twpol-parts/addon
# fi
# <file name="/opt/tripwire/etc/twpol-parts/addon" mode="append">
# 	/opt/myapp   -> $(SEC_CRIT) (recurse = 1);
