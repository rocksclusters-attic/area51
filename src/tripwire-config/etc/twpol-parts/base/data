#Tripwire policy parts
#
  # NOTE: We remove the inode attribute because when Tripwire creates a backup,
  # it does so by renaming the old file and creating a new one (which will
  # have a new inode number).  Inode is left turned on for keys, which shouldn't
  # ever change.

  # NOTE: The first integrity check triggers this rule and each integrity check
  # afterward triggers this rule until a database update is run, since the
  # database file does not exist before that point.
