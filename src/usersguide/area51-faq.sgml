<question id="Tripwire_MD5">
<para>
The MD5 Sums for My Policy/Config/Tripwire Executable Files at Installation
are different than what my Latest Report tells me. How could this happen?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Rocks calculates MD5s Policy, Config, and Tripwire files after it initializes.
If you have knowingly changed any of these, then the difference is OK.
These might have changed  if you reinitialized Tripwire interactively or
in batch mode after initial installation. If you
have NOT knowingly changed any of these items, then your computer may be
at risk. Be very suspect of the Tripwire executable whose MD5 Sum has changed.

<question id="Tripwire_Many_MD5s">
<para>
My Tripwire Report is suddenly many megabytes. What happened?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Newer versions of Enterprise Linux run a utility called 
<computeroutput>prelink</computeroutput>.  Prelink is an optimization that 
modifies ELF binaries and shared libraries to speed up loading.  Prelink is usually run as a cron job by the system. The Rocks Tripwire configuration runs 
this cron job before is creates its database. However, prelink may decide to relink already prelinked libraries. It is reasonable to use rpm to reverify all
installed RPMS
<screen>
# rpm -qa --verify
</screen>
RPM is prelink-aware where Tripwire is not. If RPM reports very many fewer errors than Tripwire, then likely prelink ran and relinked. You should reinitialize tripwire.
</para>
</answer>

<question id="Tripwire_Compile">
<para>
Is tripwire compiled statically?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Yes. Ideally the tripwire executable should be on a physically read-only
file system. This is not very practical. Compiling statically guards against
changed shared libraries. 
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>


<qandaentry>
<question id="Tripwire_Version">
<para>
What version of Tripwire is Used.
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Rocks uses the open source Tripwire for Linux Version 2.3.1-2 with
community supplied patches to enable it to compile on the most recent
version of kernel/c-libraries. Currently only and x86 version is compiled.
This version will run properly on x86_64 hosts also.
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>



<qandaentry>
<question id="More_on_Tripwire">
<para>
How do I find out more about Tripwire and how it works?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire">
Sourceforge Tripwire Homepage</ulink> is a good starting point.
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question id="Update">
<para>
I've checked all the problems that my Tripwire Report has flagged. How do I
clear these for the next report?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
As root, you need to re-initialize the Tripwire database. The Tripwire
database is signed with a randomly generated key and the MD5 sum of this
signature is reported each time the report runs. These MD5 sums should not
change unless you re-initialize. To clear the flagged problems do
</para>
<screen>
# cd /opt/tripwire/etc
# make initialize-batch
</screen>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question id="Database_Password">
<para>
What is the password for the database so that I can selectively update Tripwire entries?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
The default setup generates a random password for signing and then throws it
away. Selective update requires an interactive initializion.
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>


<qandaentry>
<question id="Interactive">
<para>
How do I setup Tripwire so that I can selectively update entries?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
As root, you need to re-initialize the Tripwire database interactively
with your self-selected site and local passphrases. 
You will first need to delete your site key
and host keys then create a new one. Do the following and follow the on-screen
directions. 
</para>
<screen>
# cd /opt/tripwire/etc
# /bin/rm *.key
# make initialize-interactive
# make check
</screen>
<para>
Once you have initialized the database. Future Tripwire warnings can be 
addressed interactively with the following 
</para>
<screen>
# cd /opt/tripwire/etc
# make update 
</screen>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<question id="Add_Files_to_be_Checked">
<para>
How do I add Files/Directories for Tripwire to Check? 
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
The Tripwire Policy file 
(<computeroutput>/opt/tripwire/etc/twpol.txt</computeroutput>)
is a monolithic text file that defines the files/directories to be 
Checked. Rocks builds this file in pieces from component files located in
the directory <computeroutput>/opt/tripwire/etc/twpol-parts</computeroutput>. 
The Area51 roll creates files in the subdirectory 
<computeroutput>/opt/tripwire/etc/twpol-parts/base</computeroutput>. 
The 
<computeroutput>/opt/tripwire/etc/twpol-parts/addon</computeroutput>
is where you should put new rules using the identical names of files
in the base directory. You should the files in the base directory as a guide.
Once you have added the files to watch you need to rebuild the tripwire
database.
</para>
<para>
If you are using that basic setup provided by Rocks, then  
</para>
<screen>
# cd /opt/tripwire/etc
# make initialize-batch
</screen>
<para>
If you have interactively setup Tripwire. Then  
</para>
<screen>
# cd /opt/tripwire/etc
# make updatedb
</screen>
</answer>

<question id="Tripwire_Rolls">
<para>
How should rolls add files for Tripwire to watch?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Rolls to should append to files in 
<computeroutput>/opt/tripwire/etc/twpol-parts/addon</computeroutput>
using the files in 
<computeroutput>/opt/tripwire/etc/twpol-parts/base</computeroutput>
as a template. For example, if an application Roll creates the directory
<computeroutput>/opt/myapp</computeroutput> then it would be appropriate
to add the following to 
<computeroutput>/opt/tripwire/etc/twpol-parts/base/appinfo</computeroutput>
in post configuration section for your roll.
<screen>
&lt;post&gt;
&lt;file name="/opt/tripwire/etc/twpol-parts/base/appinfo" mode="append"&gt;
/opt/myapp  -&gt; $(SEC_CRIT) (recurse = 1) ;
&lt;/file&gt;
&lt;/post&gt;
</screen>
